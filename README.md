![GANs_Certificate](Image/Screenshot_1.png)

## Overview

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic Mathematics
- Deep learning and CNN concepts (Andrew deep learning specialization course 4 is recommended)
- Segmentation and U-net architecture
- PyTorch

**Covered concepts:**
- GANs Basics (discriminator and generator)
- Loss function impact (BCE, and wasserstein) W-Gan-GP, SN-Gan, and Protein-Gan.
- Conditional GANs Vs Controllable Generation.
- GANs evaluation metric (FId, VGG-Loss, Inception score, SSIM, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score)
- Gans weakness and different generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs)
- StyleGan, and BigGan components and architecture methodology
- Gans application:
	- Data augmentation and privacy concerns.
	- Image-to-Image Translation models such as Pix2Pix, SRGan, PatchGan, and GauGan.
	- Unpaired image translation models such as CycleGan.
